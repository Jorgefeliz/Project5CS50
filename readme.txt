CondoMan

Written by: Jorge Feliz

About:

This web application was inspired by the problems that currently affect the condominium where I live. Which are problems when scheduling one of the spaces for events, fault reporting, knowledge of general events. The latter are only notified via WhatsApp, but are lost among the messages sent to the group of the residential where there are more than 500 people.

In this web application, the administrator will be able to publish to all residents, accept / reject events, and follow up on reported breakdowns.

Distinctiveness and Complexity:

This web application has 10 functions on its backend, only one of which renders it on the frontend. The frontend (javascrip file) consists of more than 16 functions, which communicate with the backend through webservices. In the same way, it has 5 models which leave room for improvements in the future without the need to make profound changes. In addition, elements were added to make this application look good on any device, from PC to smartphones.

Although it is true that the application needs a greater use of CSS and decorative elements, it meets all the complexity requirements required in the course.

Whatâ€™s contained in each file you created.

All the files created are the typical ones that we have seen in the course when we create a project in Django.

How to run your application.
