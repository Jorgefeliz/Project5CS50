CondoMan

Written by: Jorge Feliz

***About:***

	This web application was inspired by the problems that currently affect the condominium where I live. Which are problems when scheduling one of the spaces for events, fault reporting, knowledge of general events. The latter are only notified via WhatsApp, but are lost among the messages sent to the group of the residential where there are more than 500 apartments.

	In this web application, the administrator will be able to publish to all residents, accept / reject events, and follow up on reported breakdowns.




***Distinctiveness and Complexity:***

	This web application has 10 functions on its backend, only one of which renders it on the frontend. The frontend (javascrip file) consists of more than 16 functions, which communicate with the backend through webservices. In the same way, it has 5 models which leave room for improvements in the future without the need to make profound changes. In addition, elements were added to make this application look good on any device, from PC to smartphones.

	One feature that was implemented was that of roles. At CondoMan, the condominiums and the development manager perform different tasks based on their profile. The administrator profile can only be granted with a Django superuser. This type of feature was never taught in the course, being therefore one more point to the complexity required for this project.

	Although it is true that the application needs a greater use of CSS and decorative elements, it meets all the complexity requirements required in the course.
